Portfolio Generator 

Description

For the Portfolio Generator, leveraging Node.js, a HTML portfolio will be generated everytime the app is run. The Javascript code 
leverages asynchronous functions to simultaneously create a HTML file and copy a CSS file after prompting the user to reply to a series of 
questions. Those responses are then used to populate the webpage.
